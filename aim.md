When working with data in programming, you often encounter variables of specific data types like int or char, which can store only a single element of that data type. However, the real world is rarely so simplistic. What if you need to manage a collection of related elements, each with the same data type? Arrays offer a solution, allowing you to store multiple elements of a fixed (same) data type. With arrays, you can address this collection collectively using a single name while accessing each individual element through its unique index in the array.

But what if you want to create a collection of data elements with diverse data types and reference this entire ensemble with a single identifier? The answer is a resounding 'yes,' and the tool for this task is structures. Structures empower you to assemble a heterogeneous collection of elements, each with its own data type, and then reference this entire assembly using a single name. Structures can even include arrays, making them incredibly versatile.

In essence, a structure serves as a custom data type that can encompass multiple components of various data types, allowing you to encapsulate complex data structures in a cohesive manner. This flexibility also extends to creating arrays of structure variables, further enhancing your ability to manage and organize your data effectively.
