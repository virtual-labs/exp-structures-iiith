### Working with Simulation

This simulation consists of four steps, with increasing complexity:

- Step 1. Define a Structure
- Step 2. Declare a Structure
- Step 3: Function to Fill a Structure
- Step 4: Use Structures to Handle Data

At each step, 
* A set of instructions will be given in the top container.
* The corresponding code in C needs to be written, and then click on 'Check Solution'.
* The ideal solution will be shown in the right container next to your code.
* For going to the next step, click 'Yes' to Continue, or 'No' to stay at the same step.
* After Step 4, the simulation will resume to Step 1.
